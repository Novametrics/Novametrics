Novametrics originated through a series of advanced research seminars at Princeton University and was founded with an Innovative Research Award from the United States Secretary of Defense. We provide the next generation of big data analytics, and the most advanced data-to-decision (D2D) capabilities. Novametrics Weak-Signal AnalysisTM identifies “signals below the noise” — critical indicators that are not apparent in any single set of observations, but are predictive of outcomes and crucial for successful decision-making.

Novametrics takes advantage of the data-rich enviroment we live in today. While datasets may be of varying quality and completeness, each has the potential of carrying critical information, either by itself or, more commonly, through combination with other datasets. Novametrics Weak-Signal Analysis identifies the key combinations of indicators that are predictive of outcomes.

Novametrics developed “weak-signal analysis” – a proprietary big data analytical capability that can identify the socio-cultural and economic characteristics predictive of human behavior and outcomes. It is an innovative leader in advanced data-to-decision (D2D) capabilities.

Novametrics has successfully applied its advanced data analytics and weak-signal analysis to solve some of the most difficult problems for leading government agencies, international organizations, and private companies. Our work has ranged from violent extremism, human trafficking and illegal fishing to infectious disease, childhood malnutrition, and value-chain integrity. Within the private commercial sector, Novametrics is now providing its services to identify prime opportunities for merchandizing, sales, and product selection.
